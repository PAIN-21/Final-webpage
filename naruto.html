          Naruto has lost his both parents during the attack. Naruto grew up in the village and he was mistreated badly by everyone in village. With his loud 
        mouth and careless attitude, Naruto is determined to become the greatest ninja, hokage in his village. Along with friends, and hope. Naruto trains to become a better ninja than expected.</p>
